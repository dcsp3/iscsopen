# Overview - [IsCSOpen](https://iscsopen.com)?

A fun little website that reports on the current status of the Computer Science building at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). 

** Not affiliated with the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham** (pls don't sue me)

## Q. Why did you make this website?
A lot of people keep asking if the buidling is open or not in the [CSS](https://cssbham.com/) Discord server so I thought I'd do them a favour by making this :) 

Also my flight was delayed and I had nothing better to do :p

## Q. How does it work?
iscsopen.com makes use of advanced deep learning capabilities to determine whether the CS building is open (i hardcoded the values)
